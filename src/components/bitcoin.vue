  <p>Bitcoin, often described as a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency or
   a digital currency - is a type of money that is completely virtual.
   It's like an online version of cash. You can use it to buy products and services,
   but not many shops accept Bitcoin yet and some countries have banned it altogether.</p>
